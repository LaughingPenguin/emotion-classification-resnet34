# Emotion Classification from Voice Using ResNet34 and Transfer Learning

Our implementation of emotion detection and classification using ResNet34 and transfer learning. Main libraries used were Librosa for preprocessing audio data (.wav) into Mel spectrograms and Fast.ai to fit the convolutional neural network to our specific training dataset.

### Training Dataset

Livingstone SR, Russo FA (2018) The Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS): A dynamic, multimodal set of facial and vocal expressions in North American English. PLoS ONE 13(5): e0196391. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0196391.
